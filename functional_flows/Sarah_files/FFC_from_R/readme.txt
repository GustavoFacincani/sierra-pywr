files in *_obs folder are from running the R package
on the observed gage data ("observed") versus the TNC modeled
predictions ("predicted"). 

files in *_modeled folder are from running the R package
on the modeled unimpaired (full natural flow) daily data 
("observed") versus the TNC modeled predictions ("predictions").

Data downloaded from the TNC website for each gage site
should match the data in the *_obs folder.
